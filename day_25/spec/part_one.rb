# --- Day 25: Clock Signal ---

# You open the door and find yourself on the roof. The city sprawls away from
# you for miles and miles.

# There's not much time now - it's already Christmas, but you're nowhere near
# the North Pole, much too far to deliver these stars to the sleigh in time.

# However, maybe the huge antenna up here can offer a solution. After all, the
# sleigh doesn't need the stars, exactly; it needs the timing data they provide,
# and you happen to have a massive signal generator right here.

# You connect the stars you have to your prototype computer, connect that to the
# antenna, and begin the transmission.

# Nothing happens.

# You call the service number printed on the side of the antenna and quickly
# explain the situation. "I'm not sure what kind of equipment you have connected
# over there," he says, "but you need a clock signal." You try to explain that
# this is a signal for a clock.

# "No, no, a clock signal - timing information so the antenna computer knows how
# to read the data you're sending it. An endless, alternating pattern of
# 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1...." He trails off.

# You ask if the antenna can handle a clock signal at the frequency you would
# need to use for the data from the stars. "There's no way it can! The only
# antenna we've installed capable of that is on top of a top-secret Easter Bunny
# installation, and you're definitely not-" You hang up the phone.

# You've extracted the antenna's clock signal generation assembunny code
# (your puzzle input); it looks mostly compatible with code you worked on just
# recently.

# This antenna code, being a signal generator, uses one extra instruction:

# out x transmits x (either an integer or the value of a register) as the next
# value for the clock signal.
# The code takes a value (via register a) that describes the signal to generate,
# but you're not sure how it's used. You'll have to find the input to produce
# the right signal through experimentation.

# What is the lowest positive integer that can be used to initialize register a
# and cause the code to output a clock signal of 0, 1, 0, 1... repeating
# forever?
